		<h1>The World's History of Flight Incidents</h1>
		<h4>
			Ever since the Wright brothers decided to take the world into the skies in the early 1900s, aviation has been a major industry for transportation and entertainment alike. On any given day around eight million people fly on an airplane and each year companies work to develop new components designed to improve the experience of flying. Unfortunately, as with every advancement of technology, the miraculous benefits of such creation are sprinkled with instances of devastating failure.
